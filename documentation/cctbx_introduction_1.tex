\section{Introduction}

The CCTBX toolbox (http://cctbx.sourceforge.net) is a hybrid C++ / Python library for the development of crystallographic applications with an emphasis on rapid prototyping. The original emphasis of the library was for calculations relating to crystallographic refinement, which is evident from the examples shown on the main web page. Otherwise however the documentation is sparse. The purpose of this introduction is to show the application of the library to several commonly needed diffraction calculations, by developing a tool to compute a map from an image of the distance from each pixel to the nearest reciprocal space node, given a properly defined imgCIF file and an orientation matrix.
