"""
Boost integrated intensities to account for attenuation by a diamond anvil cell.

High pressure X-ray diffraction experiments often involve a diamond anvil pressure
cell, in which the sample is sandwiched between two anvils, effectively parallel flat
plates of diamond.  The passage of the incident and diffracted beam through the
anvils results in attenuation of both beams by the diamond by an amount that is
dependent on the path length of each beam through each anvil.

This utility calculates these path lengths and boosts the integrated reflection
intensities to remove the calculated effect of the diamond attenuation.

It is intended that this program be used to correct reflection intensities after
integration but before scaling.  Call it on the output of dials.integrate.
