abstract = {Despite significant progress in high-throughput methods in macromolecular crystallography, the production of diffraction-quality crystals remains a major bottleneck. By recording diffraction {\it in situ} from crystals in their crystallization plates at~room temperature, a number of problems associated with crystal handling and cryoprotection can be side-stepped. Using a dedicated goniometer installed on the microfocus macromolecular crystallography beamline I24 at Diamond Light Source, crystals have been studied {\it in situ} with an intense and flexible microfocus beam, allowing weakly diffracting samples to be assessed without a manual crystal-handling step but with good signal to noise, despite the background scatter from the plate. A number of case studies are reported: the structure solution of bovine enterovirus 2, crystallization screening of membrane proteins and complexes, and structure solution from crystallization hits produced {\it via} a high-throughput pipeline. These demonstrate the potential for {\it in situ} data collection and structure solution with microbeams.},

  abstract = {The PILATUS 1M detector is a hybrid pixel array detector with over one million pixels that operate in single photon counting mode. The detector, designed for macromolecular crystallography, is the largest pixel array detector currently in use at a synchrotron. It is a modular system consisting of 18 multichip modules covering an area of 21cm {$\times$} 24cm. The design of the components as well as the manufacturing of the detector including the bump-bonding was performed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). The use of a single photon counting detector for protein crystallography requires detailed studies of the charge collection properties of the silicon sensor. The 18 modules are read out in parallel, leading to a full frame readout-time of 6.7ms. This allows crystallographic data to be acquired in fine-{$\varphi$}-slicing mode with continuous rotation of the sample. The detector was tested in several experiments at the protein crystallography beamline X06SA at the Swiss Light Source at PSI. Data were collected both in conventional oscillation mode using the shutter, as well as in a fine-{$\varphi$}-slicing mode. After applying all the necessary corrections to data from a thaumatin crystal, the processing of the conventional data led to satisfactory merging {\it R}-factors of the order of 8.5%. This allows, for the first time, determination of a refined electron density map of a macromolecular biological crystal using a silicon pixel detector.},

The diffraction pattern of an ideal crystal is specified by the orientation of the crystal's cell axes with respect to a specified laboratory coordinate system, the distance between the crystal and the detector, the wavelength and the rotation range per frame. However, a realistic simulation of an experiment additionally requires at least a plausible physical model for crystal mosaicity and beam properties. To explore the physical basis of reflection shape and rocking-curve variation, the algorithm simulates the diffraction of a real crystal composed of mosaic blocks which is illuminated with a beam of given divergence and dispersion. Ray tracing for each reflection leads to reflection shapes and rocking curves that appear realistic. A program implementing the algorithm may be used to reproducibly generate data sets that model different physical aspects (imperfections) of the crystal and the experiment. Certain types of systematic errors of the experimental apparatus may also be simulated. Further applications include teaching and characterization of the properties of data-reduction algorithms.},

One million 217 × 217 μ m 2 pixels cover an area of 24.3 × 20.0 cm 2 with 300 μ m thick silicon sensors. The readout electronics enable single photon counting and a readout time of 6.7 ms. Images from this detector are spatially distorted by the influence of three factors. First, the absorption properties of the silicon leads to parallax broadening by a fraction of a pixel, depending on the angle of incidence and the photon energy. A simulation was compared to experimental data. Second, the modular architecture causes a mechanical displacement of the modules from their assumed positions. The modules are positioned on average to a precision of ∼ 300 μ m . Third, to reduce the dead area the modules are tilted by 6 ∘ and are overlapped. This introduces large distortions of several pixels which depend on the sample to detector distance. An algorithm for distortion correction of \{CCD\} detector data was adapted to correct the data of the \{PILATUS\} 1M detector. The results of the metrology as well as the parallax shift were incorporated in these corrections. Images from a Ta-mask were used to test the corrections and quantify the remaining spatial distortion. The mask images were also used to refine the individual module positions. In order to verify the distortion corrections crystallographic standards were used. The result is that images of the detector can be spatially corrected to a precision of 74 μ m or about 0.34 pixel.

With more than 1 million pixels covering an area of 243 {$\times$} 210mm, it is the largest such device constructed to date. The detector features a narrow point spread function, very fast readout and a complete absence of electronic noise. Unfortunately, this prototype detector has numerous defective pixels and sporadic errors in counting that complicate its operation. With appropriate experimental design, it was largely possible to work around these problems and successfully demonstrate the application of this technology to structure determination. Conventional coarse {$\phi$}-sliced data were collected on thaumatin and a refined electron density map was produced that showed the features expected of a map at 1.6{\AA} resolution. The results were compared with the performance of a reference charge-coupled device detector: the pixel detector is superior in speed, but showed higher {\it R}-factors because of the counting errors. Complete fine {$\phi$}-sliced data sets recorded in the continuous-rotation mode showed the predicted advantages of this data collection strategy and demonstrated the expected reduction of {\it R}-factors at high resolution. A new readout chip has been tested and shown to be free from the defects of its predecessor; a PILATUS 6M detector incorporating this new technology is under construction.},

abstract = {Procedures for detecting the point-group symmetry of macromolecular data sets are examined and enhancements are proposed. To validate a point group, it is sufficient to compare pairs of Bragg reflections that are related by each of the group's component symmetry operators. Correlation is commonly expressed in the form of a single statistical quantity (such as {\it R}${\sb merge}$) that incorporates information from all of the observed reflections. However, the usual practice of weighting all pairs of symmetry-related intensities equally can obscure the fact that the various symmetry operators of the point group contribute differing fractions of the total set. In some cases where particular symmetry elements are significantly under-represented, statistics calculated globally over all observations do not permit conclusions about the point group and Patterson symmetry. The problem can be avoided by repartitioning the data in a way that explicitly takes note of individual operators. The new analysis methods, incorporated into the program {\it LABELIT} (http://cci.lbl.gov/labelit), can be performed early enough during data acquisition, and are quick enough that it is feasible to pause to optimize the data collection strategy.},

This global refinement technique extends to multiple data sets, providing useful constraints to handle the problem of correlated parameters, particularly for small wedges of data. Examples of advanced uses of the software are given and the design is explained in detail, with particular emphasis on the flexibility and extensibility it entails.},
