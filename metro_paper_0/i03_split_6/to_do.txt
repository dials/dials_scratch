 - perform this analysis with no parallax correction i.e. show detector becomes
   distorted
 - measure more data i.e. loads of 720's good xtals at > 1 distance
 - perform all analysis in lab frame (i.e. absolute coordinate system)
 - fix limits in plots in plot_detector_shifts i.e. give uniform colouring

 - index off all 720 degrees of data, refine detector
 - split big sequence or copy detector in
 - index fixing detector model - detector.fix = all
 - rerun metrology refinement then should have apples / apples comparison

 - get hold of original DECTRIS-supplied correction tables for comparison
