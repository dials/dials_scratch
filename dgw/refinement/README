BPCX Centroid refinement
========================

This is a directory for development of an early prototype for centroid
refinement.

Some notes:
refactoring use case code earlier essential.
start with small wedge, refine simple model (i.e. no time dependence).
fix rotation axis, move everything else, CCTBX minimiser used.
Graeme to contribute to refinement code, David to XDS style integration.
start with simple model i.e. neglecting translation as this is rate determining.
split parameter class from model class i.e. detector parameterisation
from detector model - which means we can dynamically change the way that
the parameterisation is done in a harmless way. i.e. don't build the
parameterisation into the interface. Use encapsulation for this.
