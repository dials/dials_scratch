Building Everything from Scratch

We are in the process of refining the build process (Nat Echols @ LBL is doing the work for this) such that we can start with a clean directory and with a few scripts bootstrap a full working configuration.

This essentially needs to be done in two phases:

    build your base python
    build CCTBX on top

Building your Python

To get this started, get the auto_builder script

svn export https://cctbx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cctbx/trunk/auto_build

And then:

mkdir /where/we/want/this/installed
cd /where/we/want/this/installed
/path/to/auto_build/install --all

Then let this run for some time... not sure for the moment if --all is the best option - it does install a bunch of stuff - but it should be a good place to start. The following packages are installed this way:

biopython-1.58.tar.gz
freetype-2.4.2.tar.gz
h5py-2.0.1-edit.tar.gz
hdf5-1.8.8.tar.bz2
Imaging-1.1.7.tar.gz
matplotlib-1.2.0.tar.gz
numpy-1.6.1.tar.gz
PyRTF-0.45.tar.gz
reportlab-2.6.tar.gz
wxPython-src-2.8.12.1.tar.gz

though the versions of the packages may depend on the OS version you have. Certainly OS X.7 gives a different package list to the venerable RHEL5. Once this is complete the next step is to check out all of the CCTBX components on top...
Building CCTBX with this Python

To get started with this, download everything using this script:

cd /where/we/want/this/installed/cctbx_sources
svn export https://cctbx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/cctbx/trunk/libtbx/development
./development/cctbx_svn_getting_started.csh

Then wait a while again while everything downloads... then when it's done with it's moving etc:

mv sources/* .
rmdir sources
cd ../cctbx_build
./base/bin/python ../cctbx_sources/cctbx_project/libtbx/configure.py cctbx rstbx iotbx
. setpaths.sh
make

This is for the basic cctbx - no labelit etc. which needs to be added and built.
