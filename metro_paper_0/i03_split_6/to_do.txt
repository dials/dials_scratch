 - perform this analysis with no parallax correction i.e. show detector becomes distorted
 - measure more data i.e. loads of 720's good xtals at > 1 distance
 - perform all analysis in lab frame (i.e. absolute coordinate system)
 - fix limits in plots in plot_detector_shifts i.e. give uniform colouring
